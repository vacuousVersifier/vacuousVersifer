# Hello! 
I'm just your average hobbyist programmer. I'm not very good at all of this but I try to learn whenever I can.

Some of the things I work on are discord bots, python scripts, javascript/nodejs/websites, p5.js skethes, java and more!

# Some of my projects
- [A 2d game engine](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/2DGameEngine)
- [A silly discord bot about the spanish inquisition](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/SpanishInquisitionBot)
- [A website I made for my teacher](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/MrsKList)
- [And a website with a bunch of cool micro-projects](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/P5ojects)
