# Hello! 
I am a junior, and while I plan on becoming an educator, I have a love for programming. I'm definitely still a student, but I learn more everyday!

I'm interested in many things, but on GitHub, discord bots, python, javascript / nodejs, p5.js, java, and more!!

I'm currrently in a computer programming class in my highschool, but I plan on going to WSU's computer science program!

# Some of my projects
- [A 2d game engine](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/2DGameEngine)
- [A silly discord bot about the spanish inquisition](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/SpanishInquisitionBot)
- [A website I made for my teacher](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/MrsKList)
- [And a website with a bunch of cool micro-projects](https://github.com/vacuousVersifer/P5ojects)
